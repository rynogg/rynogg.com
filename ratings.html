<h1>NOTICE: The ratings system has been discontinued.&ensp;
Videos will now show disclaimers instead.</h1>
<p>Not everything that I've made is child friendly.&ensp;
This is why I made this.&ensp;
So that way you know what you're getting into.&ensp;
They're represented by colors, if that's your thing.&ensp;

<a><center><img src="assets/img/old/ratingpurple.png"></center></a>
<p>Purple means that there isn't an age rating set to the video and viewer discretion is advised.&ensp;
This warning will most likely appear at the beginning of full stream videos.&ensp;
Any video that does not explicitly list any sort of maturity warning during or after the intro should be assumed to have this rating.&ensp;
Video listings on this website should list other ratings in the future whether or not they exist in the beginning of the videos or not.
</p>
<a><center><img src="assets/img/old/ratingblue.png"></center></a>
<p>Blue means that the video is child-friendly and that parents shouldn't worry about the content of that specific video.&ensp;
This warning will most likely appear in simple demonstration videos.&ensp;
It's similar to MPAA's "Rated G" or ESRB's "Rated E."&ensp;
Any sort of cussing should be cut out of these kinds of videos, as there will be no bleeps at all.&ensp;
Sexual references will be nonexistant in these videos.&ensp;
It should be noted that the RynoGG channel is aimed more towards teens and adults, and any parents that allow their child to watch 
my content should supervise and watch the video ahead of time to make sure that the video is something that they would want to show 
to their children.
</p>
<a><center><img src="assets/img/old/ratinggreen.png"></center></a>
<p>Green means that the video is child-friendly to an extent, but does cross a little bit of barriers when it comes to maturity.&ensp;
This warning will most likely appear in tutorials and more complex demonstration videos.&ensp;
It's similar to MPAA's "Rated PG" or ESRB's "Rated E10+."&ensp;
Any sort of cussing will be censored with bars and bleeps.&ensp;
Sexual references will be nonexistant in these videos.
</p>
<a><center><img src="assets/img/old/ratingyellow.png"></center></a>
<p>Yellow means that the video is aimed at teens and contains some mature content.&ensp;
This warning will most likely appear in gaming or comedic videos, and in many animations.&ensp;
It's similar to MPAA's "Rated PG13" or ESRB's "Rated T."
There will be cussing.&ensp;
Sexual references are toned down, but do exist.&ensp;
Any sort of racial joke will be censored with bars and bleeps.
</p>
<a><center><img src="assets/img/old/ratingorange.png"></center></a>
<p>Orange means that the video is aimed at late teens and adults and contains mature content.&ensp;
This warning will most likely appear in some gaming or comedic videos, and in some joke videos.&ensp;
I wouldn't classify comedic videos and joke videos as being the same thing.&ensp;
It's similar to MPAA's "Rated R" or ESRB's "Rated M."
There will be cussing.&ensp;
Sexual references are described in words.&ensp;
Any sort of racial joke will be censored with bars and bleeps.
</p>
<a><center><img src="assets/img/old/ratingred.png"></center></a>
<p>Red means that the video is aimed at adults and contains explicit content.&ensp;
This warning should not appear often.&ensp;
Videos with this warning are age-restricted manually.&ensp;
It's similar to MPAA's "Rated NC-17" or ESRB's "Rated AO."
There will be cussing.&ensp;
Sexual references are described in words.&ensp;
Although nudity is unlikely, there might be a chance.&ensp;
Racial jokes are not censored.
